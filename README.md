# Project Name

Multi-part feedback form

## Description

Duration: 9hrs

Objective: 

To create a multi-part feedback form where the user enters specific data on each page, sees a review of their feedback, and then submits their feedback to the database.

Problems encoutered:

- Deciding how to oganize the data in a sustainable way

    Solution: 
   
    - I didn't get to a solution. I created one reducer that had a state of an array
    - I did find a solution from another developer which was to create a different reducer for each part of the feedback

- Deciding how to make a multi-part feedback form

    Solution: 

    - After researching, I decided to not use a form tag and to create div tags for each components of the project
    

Next Steps: 

- Further style the project
- Implement a more sustainable way to gather the data client side (create reducers for each part of the feedback)
